This repository contains a work developed for the Agent Oriented Software Engineering class of the Software Engineering graduation course.

The objective of the work was to develop an agent who could play the [Scopa card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa). At the end 
of the course, all agents developed by each student played against each other in a championship. This agent, developed by me, was the
winner.
